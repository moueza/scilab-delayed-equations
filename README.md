Numerical computing (tag : Matlab, Scilab)

Find just a solution non constant is enough job !

Be to solve f(x+1)=f(x) easy constant functions fit but excluded, but 1-T periodic functions fit OK

            f(x+1)=2*f(x) easy 2^x fits for integers OK, but in |R ?
            
            f(x)=f(2*x) ? (non const equired) Can we help with derivative too ?
